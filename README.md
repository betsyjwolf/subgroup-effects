## Abstract

Education researchers are increasingly interested in understanding ‘what works’ for whom and under what conditions, often through subgroup and compositional analyses. Yet findings from these analyses are frequently reported without empirical or theoretical justification, raising questions about their credibility. This paper uses data from the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) to identify systematic subgroup and compositional effects across educational evaluations and to explore empirical reasons for them. We find that within studies, treatment effects were systematically more favorable for economically disadvantaged students and female students and less favorable for high-performing students, though the differences were small in magnitude. Across studies, evaluations with higher proportions of economically disadvantaged students and students with disabilities had larger treatment effects on average, but these compositional effects could be explained by differences in intervention characteristics. Despite these patterns, we observe substantial treatment effect heterogeneity, underscoring the need to look beyond the average treatment effect. We discuss implications for researchers, funders of research, and policymakers.
